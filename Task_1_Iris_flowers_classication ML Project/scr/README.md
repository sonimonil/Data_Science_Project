Iris Flower Classification ML Project:

The Iris flower data set is a specific set of information compiled by Ronald Fisher, a biologist, in the 1930s. It describes particular biological characteristics of various types of Iris flowers, specifically, the length and width of both pedals and the sepals, which are part of the flowerâ€™s reproductive system.

Here, you will find a collection of code, documentation, and resources related to the assigned task. In this project, we aim to classify iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements using machine learning techniques. This README file provides an overview of the project, its contents, and instructions to get started.

roject Overview:

The Iris Flower Classification ML Project is a classic machine learning task that involves training a model to predict the species of iris flowers based on their physical attributes. The dataset used in this project contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three different species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica

Project Structure:

This code directory contains Jupyter notebooks with the code used for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
