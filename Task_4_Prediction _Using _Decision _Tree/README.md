Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm:

Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.

The Iris dataset was used in R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper, The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems, and can also be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The columns in this dataset are:

                                - Id
                                - SepalLengthCm
                                - SepalWidthCm
                                - PetalLengthCm
                                - PetalWidthCm
                                - Species
