Task 2 - Stock Market Prediction and Forecasting using LSTM:

This repository aims to provide a comprehensive solution for predicting and forecasting stock market trends using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models.

Overview:

The stock market is a complex and dynamic system influenced by various factors, making accurate predictions a challenging task. This project leverages LSTM, a powerful deep learning technique known for its ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data.

By employing LSTM models, we can analyze historical stock market data, extract patterns, and make informed predictions about future market trends. The project offers a robust framework for data preprocessing, model development, training, and evaluation, enabling users to experiment and refine their forecasting models.

Results:

The precise application and training of the Stacked LSTM model determine the outcome of the Stock Market Prediction and Forecasting assignment. We can get predictions and projections for future stock prices by developing the algorithm on existing stock price data.

Evaluation metrics like mean absolute error (MAE) as well as root mean square error (RMSE) can be used to assess the model's performance. Better prediction accuracy is shown by lower values for these parameters. The performance of the algorithm can also be evaluated visually by comparing the anticipated with actual stock prices using visualisations like line graphs.

Key Features:

Data preprocessing: Prepare and clean historical stock market data for model training and testing.
LSTM model architecture: Utilize LSTM layers to capture temporal patterns and dependencies in the data.
Training and optimization: Train the LSTM model using various optimization algorithms to improve accuracy and convergence.
Forecasting: Make predictions and generate forecasts for future stock market trends.
